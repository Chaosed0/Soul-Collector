<h1>Soul Collector</h1>

A video game made for CMPSC483W, software design, taught by Max Fomitchev at The Pennsylvania State University.

The game is a top-down adventure game located in purgatory. You have been smited, the pieces of your soul scattered; you must navigate the labrynthine purgatory and gather the pieces of your soul without becoming a beast.
