Unit tests

Player movement test
1. Open Player.cpp. Scroll down to Player::Update and place a breakpoint at the start of the "if(moveUp)" block of code.
2. Run the game while debugging. Press the "start" button.
3. Press the 'w' key.
4. Step through the code until the line "movement.y += std::max(-moveSpeed, (float)nearest);" is encountered.
5. Step once more. Verify that the value of "movement.y" has changed to "(0.0, -2.0)".
