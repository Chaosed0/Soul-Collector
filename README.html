<h1>Useful stuff</h1>

<h2>Git</h2>

<p><b>Setting Up</b></p>
<p>
Run through <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/generating-ssh-keys">this guide</a> until you get to step 4. Do the first command, then go to your Assembla profile. Go to "Manage SSH Keys", and do a paste into the box (the command executed will have copied the ssh key, so no need to copy anything). </p>

<p><b>Using Git</b></p>
<p>First thing you want to do is to identify yourself. Run the following commands with your own info substituted:</p>

<p><code>
git config --global user.email "EMAIL@EMAIL.COM"<br/>
git config --global user.name "USERNAME"
</code></p>

<p>Now, to clone the repository (if you don't have a local copy):</p>

<p><code>
git clone git@git.assembla.com:cmpsc483w-un.git
</code></p>

<p>If you're starting work from somewhere you already have the repository, make sure to pull the most recent changes before starting work:</p>

<p><code>
git pull
</code></p>

<p>After making some changes, commit to your local repository (make a local backup):</p>

<p><code>
git add *
git commit
</code></p>

<p>The second command will bring up a vim prompt to type in a commit message. Pay attention to the message at the bottom - it will tell you what changes you made. Commit messages should take the following form:</p>

<p><code>
Simple, short explanation<br/><br/>

A bit of a longer, detailed explanation here, if needed.
Can span multiple lines.
</code></p>

<p>To push to the remote server (our Assembla repository):</p>

<p><code>
git push
</code></p>

<p>If someone's made changes before you, you'll have to pull their changes first and possibly merge their changes before commiting and pushing again.</p>

<p>...More to come later</p>
